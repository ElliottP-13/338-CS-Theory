%When writing up your solution, comment out the following until you reach Problem 1.
\noindent
This assignment is due on {\bf Monday, April 28, 11:30pm}. It is strongly
encouraged that you use Latex to generate a single pdf file and upload it
under {\em Assignment 6} on D2L. But there will NOT be a penalty for not
using Latex (to finish the assignment). This is {\bf not} a group-assignment,
so you must finish the assignment by yourself.
